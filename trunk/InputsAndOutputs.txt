OUTPUTS:

vision - container class vision: collection of each thing that is seen with classification
				 where it is, and where it is pointed

semi sup - single set of initial weights (one for each behavior)

neural net - produces set of modified weights

rules - a vector for each rule, when take a weighted sum produces a movement vector


INPUTS:

vision - the state of the world/screen

semi sup - a collection of sets of weights and a fitness level for each

neural net - set of initial weights

rules - weights for each rule
