OUTPUTS:

vision - container class vision: collection of each thing that is seen with classification
				 where it is, and where it is pointed
	- used in rules and fitness function

semi sup - single set of initial weights

neural net - produces a movement vector

rules - a vector for each rule, when take a weighted sum produces a movement vector


INPUTS:

vision - the state of the world/screen

semi sup - a collection of sets of weights and a fitness level for each

neural net - vectors from each rule

rules - weights for each rule

rule space
a neural net which produces a vector which takes as inputs the state of the creature and it's vision and an error fuction which may be omnicient

neural net takes as parameter numof inputs/outputs etc

online training for each rule as well
